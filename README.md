# Visual_Basic

VB development at work:

-Two photos referring to my project within the company where I work. An HR Portal developed in VBA for consulting payslips, uploading files and general queries.

-Some scripts for future projects.

-A lot of code I couldn't include here because it contains sensitive information.
